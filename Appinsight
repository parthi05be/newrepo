To configure Azure Application Insights for a Virtual Machine (VM), you need to ensure several prerequisites are met:

1. Azure Subscription & Resources
An active Azure subscription.
A Virtual Machine (Windows/Linux) running on Azure.
A Log Analytics workspace (optional, but recommended for logs and metrics).
An Application Insights resource created in the Azure Portal.
2. Permissions
You need Contributor or Owner role on the VM and Application Insights.
If using Log Analytics, ensure you have permission to link the VM.
3. VM Configuration
The VM should have network connectivity to Azure (internet access or a private link).
Windows VM should have at least PowerShell 5.1 (or later).
Linux VM should have Python installed if using the custom telemetry approach.
4. Install and Configure Application Insights Agent
For Windows VMs
Enable Application Insights Agent via the Azure Portal:
Go to Azure Portal > Virtual Machines.
Select your VM > Insights > Enable.
It will install the Application Insights Agent and configure monitoring.
Or, manually install the agent using PowerShell:
Install-Module -Name Az.ApplicationMonitor
Install-ApplicationMonitorAgent
For Linux VMs
Install the Application Insights agent manually:
wget https://aka.ms/linux-monitor-agent -O InstallMonitorAgent.sh
chmod +x InstallMonitorAgent.sh
sudo ./InstallMonitorAgent.sh
5. Configure Telemetry Collection
Use an Instrumentation Key (IK) or Connection String from Application Insights.
Modify application configuration files to send logs to Application Insights.
Use SDKs (e.g., .NET, Java, Node.js, Python) for deeper insights.
6. Enable Azure Monitor VM Insights (Optional)
Navigate to Virtual Machines > Select VM > Insights > Enable Monitoring.
It installs the Dependency Agent for collecting additional performance data.
7. Verify Data Collection
In Azure Portal, go to Application Insights > Live Metrics.
Check logs in Log Analytics Workspace using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
