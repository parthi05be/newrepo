To configure Application Insights on Azure virtual machines, you'll need to meet the following network prerequisites:

1. **Internet Connectivity**: Ensure that your virtual machines have internet access to send telemetry data to Application Insights.
2. **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewall rules to allow outbound traffic to Azure Monitor services. Specifically, you'll need to allow traffic on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 5671 (AMQP).
3. **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: If you're using Network Security Groups, ensure that the appropriate outbound rules are configured to allow traffic to Azure Monitor.
4. **Private Link**: For enhanced security, you can use Azure Private Link to connect your virtual machines to Azure Monitor services privately over the Microsoft backbone network[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-enable?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

To configure Application Insights on Azure virtual machines, you need to ensure the following network requirements are met:

1. **Internet Access**: Your virtual machines must have internet access to send telemetry data to the Application Insights service.

2. **Firewall and Network Security Group (NSG) Rules**: Allow outbound traffic on the following ports:
   - **Port 443 (HTTPS)**: Used for secure communication with the Application Insights ingestion endpoints.
   - **Port 5671 (AMQP)**: Optional, used for sending telemetry via Azure Event Hubs.

3. **DNS Resolution**: Ensure that the virtual machines can resolve the Application Insights endpoints through DNS.

4. **Private Link (Optional)**: For added security, you can use Azure Private Link to connect your virtual machines to Azure Monitor services over a private network.

By configuring these network settings, your virtual machines will be able to communicate effectively with Application Insights. If you need more specific steps or have any other questions, feel free to ask!


To configure the outbound rules for Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) to send data to Application Insights, you'll need to ensure that the following settings are in place:

1. **Allow HTTPS Traffic (Port 443)**:
   - This is essential for secure communication with the Application Insights ingestion endpoints.
   - Outbound traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) should be allowed.

2. **Allow AMQP Traffic (Port 5671)** (Optional):
   - This port is used for sending telemetry via Azure Event Hubs.
   - If you're using Event Hubs as a telemetry pipeline, ensure that outbound traffic on port 5671 (AMQP) is allowed.

3. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Ensure that the VM can resolve the Application Insights endpoints. This is typically done through Azure-provided DNS services.
  
4. **Outbound NSG Rules**:
   - If you have Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to your VMs, ensure that the outbound rules are configured to allow traffic on the above ports.
  
5. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Make sure any firewall settings are not blocking the required outbound traffic.

6. **Service Tags**:
   - For ease of configuration, you can use Azure Service Tags like `AzureMonitor` to allow outbound traffic to Azure Monitor services, which includes Application Insights.

By configuring these rules, your Azure VMs will be able to communicate effectively with Application Insights, ensuring that telemetry data is successfully sent and monitored.

If you have any more specific questions or need additional guidance, feel free to ask!





1. Outbound Internet Access
Your VM must have outbound access to the internet or the required Azure services. Ensure outbound access to:

Endpoint: dc.services.visualstudio.com
Port: 443 (HTTPS)
Protocol: HTTPS
If your VM is behind a firewall or proxy, you need to explicitly allow traffic to this domain.

2. Required Endpoints for Application Insights
To collect telemetry, your VM must be able to send data to these endpoints:

Service	Endpoint	Port	Description
Telemetry Ingestion	https://dc.services.visualstudio.com	443	Sends application logs, metrics, and traces
Live Metrics Stream	https://rt.services.visualstudio.com	443	Enables live telemetry for real-time monitoring
Configuration & Health	https://monitoring.azure.com	443	Fetches configuration settings from Azure Monitor
Availability Tests	https://*.applicationinsights.azure.com	443	Required for availability monitoring
Note: If using a specific Application Insights region, replace *.applicationinsights.azure.com with the corresponding regional endpoint.

3. Network Security Group (NSG) Rules
If your VM is inside an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and is protected by Network Security Groups (NSGs), make sure the following outbound rule is in place:

Source: Virtual Machine
Destination: dc.services.visualstudio.com
Port: 443
Direction: Outbound
Action: Allow
4. Firewall and Proxy Configuration
If a firewall or proxy is used, allow the required endpoints and ensure the proxy does not block telemetry data.

Enable TLS 1.2 for secure communication.
If using a proxy, configure the Application Insights Agent or Azure Monitor Agent to work with it.
5. Private Link for Secure Telemetry (Optional)
If you want to send telemetry without using the public internet, you can use Azure Private Link to connect Azure Monitor and Application Insights to your VM securely within your VNet.

6. Testing Connectivity
To verify that your VM can reach the required endpoints, use PowerShell or telnet:

powershell
Copy code
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName dc.services.visualstudio.com -Port 443
If the connection fails, check your NSG rules, firewall, or proxy settings.

Next Steps
Install & configure the Application Insights agent or Azure Monitor Agent on the VM.
Ensure telemetry is sent by checking Application Insights logs.
Monitor network traffic using Azure Network Watcher.
